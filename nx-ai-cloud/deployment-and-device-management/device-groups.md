# Device groups

You can manage large numbers of devices and bulk-assign models with device groups.

From the device listing, you can select some devices.

The selected devices can then be added to an existing or a new group with the form that pops up.

Bulk assigning a model is simple: click the "Assign a model to all devices in the group" button and follow the next steps.

You will be redirected to the models listing page, and on the available models, the button "Use on group" will appear. Clicking this button will bulk assign that model to the current group. You can cancel the assignment in the blue area at the top.

When you select a model, you will be redirected back to the group, and the model will be deployed to the devices as soon as they connect to the platform.
